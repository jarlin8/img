Start serving properly sized, smart cropped & optimized images, plus CSS, JS and fonts from our CDN with a click; On the fly convert AVIF & WebP support.

== Description ==

**An easy to use plugin that can help you solve within minutes all your website’s image-related problems.**

Display properly sized, smartly cropped and optimized images on your website; Images are processed on the fly and served from our CDN, in the next-gen WebP & AVIF formats, if the browser supports it.

= Do I need this plugin? =
If you have a WordPress website with images then the answer is: most probably yes!
Did you ever test your website with tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">PageSpeed Insights</a> or <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a> and received complains about images not being properly sized or being too large? Or that you should use "next-gen" images like WebP or AVIF? Or that the website should "defer offscreen images"?
ShortPixel Adaptive Images comes to the rescue and resolves your site's image-related problems in no time.

= What are the benefits? =

[vimeo https://vimeo.com/407181635 ]

Imagine that you could have all your image-related website problems solved with a simple click, wouldn't that be great?
Usually the images are the biggest resource on a website page. With just one click, ShortPixel Adaptive Images replaces all your website's pics with properly sized, smartly-cropped, optimized images and offloads them on to the ShortPixel's global CDN.
And for more Google love the plugin serves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP">WebP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#AV1_Image_File_Format_(AVIF)">AVIF</a> images to the right browsers auto-magically!

= What are the features? =
* new, lightweight, pure JavaScript Adaptive Images engine (jQuery not required anymore) starting with version 3
* same visual quality but smaller images thanks to ShortPixel algorithms
* smart cropping - <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/182-what-is-smart-cropping" target="_blank">see an example</a>
* serve only appropriately sized images depending on the visitor's viewport
* lazy load support with adjustable threshold; browser native lazy loading support is also available
* automatically serves WebP & AVIF images to browsers that support this format. Animated Gifs are supported too!
* caching and serving from a global CDN for images, as well as CSS, JS and fonts
* all major image galleries, sliders, page builders are supported
* onboarding wizard which includes a tool that suggests the best settings for each site
* Low Quality Imaage Placeholders (LQIP) support
* support for JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP
* convert to WebP and AVIF on the fly
* adjustable size breakpoints when resizing images
* possibility to deactivate the plugin functionality for logged-in users
* variety of settings for an increased flexibility in the plugin functionality


= Do I need an account to test this plugin? =
No, just go ahead and install then activate it on your WordPress website and you’ll automatically receive 500 image optimization credits, which equals to 2.5GB of CDN traffic, or approximately 2500 visits!

= How much does it cost? =
When using ShortPixel Adaptive Images, only the CDN traffic <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/460-spai-new-how-are-the-credits-counted">is counted</a>, if you choose to use our CDN. The free tier receives 100 image optimization credits, which equals to 500MB of CDN traffic, or approximately 500 visits. Paid plans start at $4.99 and both <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing-one-time">one-time</a> and <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing">monthly</a> plans are available.
Even better: if you already use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/">ShortPixel Image Optimizer</a> then you can use the same credits with ShortPixel Adaptive Images!

= How does this work? =
Different visitors have different devices (laptop, mobile phone, tablet) each with its own screen resolution. ShortPixel AI considers the device's resolution and then serves the right sized image for each placeholder.
Let's consider a webpage with a single 640x480 pixels image.
When viewed from a laptop the image will retain it 640x480px size but it will be optimized and served from a CDN.
When the same webpage is viewed from a mobile phone, the image will be resized (for example) to 300x225px, optimized and served from CDN.
This way, neither time nor bandwidth will be wasted by visitors.
Please note that the first time the call for a specific image is made to our servers, the original image will be served temporarily.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens when the quota is exceeded? =

In your WP dashboard you'll be warned when your quota is about to be exhausted and also when it was exceeded. When the quota is exhausted, the plugin will simply serve the original images from your server, without compression or resizing, until the quota resets.
The images that weren't already optimized will be served directly from your website.

= What Content Delivery Network (CDN) do you use? =

ShortPixel Adaptive Images uses <a href="https://bunny.net/" target="_blank">bunny.net</a> to offload the images - a global CDN with <a href="https://bunny.net/network" target="_blank">54 edge locations</a> around the world.
Both free and paid plans use the same CDN with the same number of locations.
You can independently check out how the bunny.net CDN compares to other CDN providers <a href="https://www.cdnperf.com/">here</a> (wordlwide) and <a href="https://www.cdnperf.com/#!performance,North%20America">here</a> (North America).

= Can I use a different CDN? =

Sure. <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/180-can-i-use-a-different-cdn-with-shortpixel-adaptive-images">Here</a> you can see how to configure it with Cloudflare and <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/200-setup-your-stackpath-account-so-that-it-can-work-with-shortpixel-adaptive-images-api">here</a>’s how to configure it with STACKPATH. Please note that when using a different CDN, image credits will be consumed instead of CDN traffic.
If you need further assistance please <a href="https://shortpixel.com/contact">contact us</a>

= What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =
You can stop using the SPAI whenever you want but this means your site will suddenly become slower.
Basically, your website will revert to the original, un-optimized images served from your server.

= Are there different image optimization levels available? =
Yes, you can compress images as Lossy, Glossy or Lossless.
You can find out more about each optimization level <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/11-lossy-glossy-or-lossless-which-one-is-the-best-for-me">here</a> or can run some free tests to optimize images <a href="https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression">here</a>

= I already used ShortPixel Image Optimizer, can I also use this? =
Certainly!

= What is the difference between this plugin and ShortPixel Image Optimizer? =
You can see <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/179-shortpixel-adaptive-images-vs-shortpixel-image-optimizer">here</a> the differences between the two services.

= Where can I optimize my images? There's nothing on my admin panel. =
SPAI works differently than a regular image optimizer. <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/132-how-shortpixel-adaptive-images-work" target="_blank">Here's</a> what it does.

== WP CLI commands ==

Use the following WP CLI commands to clear the CSS cache and the Low Quality Image Placeholders:
    `wp shortpixel clear_css`
    `wp shortpixel clear_lqips`

== For developers ==

If in Media Library there are main images which end in the usual thumbnail size suffix (eg. -100x100) please set in wp-config.php this:

    define('SPAI_FILENAME_RESOLUTION_UNSAFE', true);

If you need to do a post-processing in JavaScript after the image/tag gets updated by ShortPixel AI, you can add a callback like this:

    jQuery( document ).ready(function() {
        ShortPixelAI.registerCallback('element-updated', function(elm){
            // elm is the jQuery object, elm[0] is the tag
            console.log("element updated: " + elm.prop('nodeName'));
            });
    });

For changing the original URL of the image, that is detected by ShortPixel, use this filter that receives the original URL:

    add_filter('shortpixel/ai/originalUrl', 'my_function');

Sometimes, when the option to crop the images is active, SPAI thinks it's not safe to crop an image, but you want to crop it anyway. Please add this attribute to force the cropping:

    <img data-spai-crop="true" ....

ShortPixel Adaptive Images triggers a JS event after the initial processing of  the HTML page in browser: spai-body-handled, an event after each processed DOM mutation, if at least one URL was replaced: spai-block-handled and an event after each element has its URL updated lazily (entering the viewport): spai-element-handled

In order to exclude specific images, you can also add the following attributes to the markup, inside the `IMG` tag:

    `<img data-spai-excluded="true" ...>` --> this will completely exclude from processing the image which has this attribute;
    `<img data-spai-eager="true" ...>` --> this will exclude the image from being lazy-loaded by the plugin;
    `<img data-spai-noresize="true" ...>` --> this will prevent the image from being resized by the plugin.

For adding custom replacement rules use:

    add_filter('shortpixel/ai/customRules', 'my_function');

The function will receive an array and should append to that array elements with the following structure: ['tagName', 'attrToBeChecked', 'classFilter', 'attributeFilter', false(reserved), 'attributeValueFilter', isEager(bool)]. Starting 3.0, you can also append ShortPixel\AI\TagRule instances
A real-life example for custom image attributes, a custom srcset and a custom JSON data attribute:

`add_filter('shortpixel/ai/customRules', 'spai_to_iconic');
function spai_to_iconic($regexItems) {
    $regexItems[] = array('img', 'data-iconic-woothumbs-src', false, false, false, false, true);
    $regexItems[] = array('img', 'data-large_image', false, false, false, false, true);
    $regexItems[] = new ShortPixel\AI\TagRule('img', 'srcset', false, false, false, false, false,
                    'srcset', 'replace_custom_srcset');
    $regexItems[] = new ShortPixel\AI\TagRule('div', 'data-default', 'iconic-woothumbs-all-images-wrap', false, false, false, false,
                        'srcset', 'replace_custom_json_attr');
    return $regexItems;
}`
